  ## About Pixegon

  
content: >
  ### We have been building mobile since day 1


  Brandon and Ashley Trebitowski embarked on their journey with Treb Studios in late 2012. Within a mere few months of operation, they swiftly recognized the mounting workload and initiated a process of expansion by bringing in and nurturing talented individuals, driven by the success of both small and large projects. 
  
  
  As the value and commitment of their team became evident, the decision was made in 2015 to undergo a transformation, rebranding Treb Studios as Pixegon. Pixegon stands apart as more than a conventional code factory. We take pride in assisting established corporations, startups, and individuals in crafting impactful software solutions for their ventures. 
  
  
  The unwavering dedication, compassion, and innovative spirit of our team members are the driving forces behind Pixegonâ€™s esteemed reputation as a leader in the realm of software development.
