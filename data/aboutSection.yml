  ## About Pixegon

  
content: >
  ### We have been building mobile since day 1


  Out of college, Brandon Trebitowski worked as a mobile engineer for four years before being laid off. In 2012, on a leap of faith, Brandon started Treb Studios. Shortly after, Brandon realized that he had too much work and began hiring and cultivating employees through small and large project successes. 
  
  
  After establishing the value and dedication of his team, he decided to rebrand and centralize the focus of the company by rebranding Treb Studios as Pixegon in 2015.


  Pixegon is not just your typical code factory. We enjoy helping established companies, startups and individuals, build meaningful software for their businesses. The dedication, care, and innovation of our employees is what make Pixegon a recognized leader in the software development space.
